Candle for Raspberry Pi 4
-----------
GRBL controller application with G-Code visualizer written in Qt and able
to run on a Raspberry Pi.
For the Windows and Linux versions and full support please go to the original site

https://github.com/Denvi/Candle

Also use that site for any issues with the software and feature requests.

Note: I setup this repository for 2 reasons:
1. I wanted to learn how to use github so this is my "Hello World" test repository and
2. since there's interest in running Candle on a raspi I wanted to add the info to Denvi's repository but not knowing what or how to do it I thought creating a temporary repository to play with was a safer solution. Hopefully the wiki found here and the Candle.zip file will eventually end up on the Denvi/Candle site.
I apologise in advance for any strange formatting or information appearing on this site since it is my test site.

The information here is based on issue #77 on Denvi's site:
https://github.com/Denvi/Candle/issues/77
and many thanks to everyone who contributed to the discussion there. All I did was to put the information in one place.
